%% Reading and displaying 1D temporal data
% Here we show examples of data taken from single dimension of
% *time*. Each time point can have a _single_ number, or _multiple_ numbers
% associated with it.

%% How to run this demo
% You can download the datasets from Canvas

%% Example of 1D, single channel ECG data 
% We examine ECG data here, which measures the electrical activity of the heart
% over time, using electrodes that are attached to the patients skin. 

% This is the path and name of the ECG file.
ecgNamePath = fullfile(pwd, 'ecg', 'ecgdemodata1.mat');

% Load the MAT file containing the ECG values.
ecgStruct = load(ecgNamePath);

% We have 44604 time points with a single value.

% This is the values of the first 5 points.

% Create an empty figure for display.

% We are looking at all the data here. What happens when we only look at
% the first few points? Here we start by looking at the first 1/2 points,
% then we look at the first 1/4 points, etc...

%% Example of 1D, single channel EEG data 
% Here we have a subject who had a single electrode connected to their
% scalp. The subject was recorded for 3 minutes with pre-seizure, seizure, and
% post-seizure activity captured. The data is simply stored in a textfile
% where each line stores a value.

eegSingleNamePath = fullfile(pwd, 'eeg','130-2_c4.asc.txt');

% Read in the text data.

% actvities for the first 5 points in time.

%% Example of 1D, multi-channel data
% For a particular point in time, a data point can have several values
% associated with it. So now we look at multi-channel data with 3 data
% values that correspond to one time point.
