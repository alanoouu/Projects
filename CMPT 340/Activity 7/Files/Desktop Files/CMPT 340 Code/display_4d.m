%% Reading and displaying 4D data.
% Here we will show examples of 3D volumes being recorded over time. Note
% here that the 4D means we have 3 spatial and 1 time dimensions.

%% How to run this demo 
% You can download the datasets from Canvas
% 
% Download and extract */4dpet/4dpet.zip*.

%%
% You should have this directory structure:
%   
%   /display_4d.m
%   /4dpet/001.img
%   /4dpet/001.mhd
%   ...
%   /4dpet/016.img
