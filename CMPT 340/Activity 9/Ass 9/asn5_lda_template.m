%% Classification using Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)
% CMPT 340 - Activity 09
%
% In this assignment, we are going to examine data from patients with
% Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Specifically, we are going to try to distinguish
% between patients with advanced stages of MS vs earlier stages of MS. We
% are going to make this distinction (classification) using ONLY
% information from the patients' spinal cord in an MRI.
%
%
% *Data files:*
% We have extracted some features from 30 patients with different stages of
% MS. The features are measurements of the spinal cord in an MRI. For
% example, the volume of the spinal cord, the average intensity within the
% cord, etc. The corresponding severity of MS for each patient is also
% included.
%
% The data is in the file "SC.mat" and how to load the data is given below.
%
% *Instructions:*
% Detailed instructions are below. Please read the instructions carefully
% and follow along, filling out the requested areas.
%
%
% *Marking:*
% Please note the TA marks based on the HTML and the code so please keep
% both readable. Marks may be deducted for poorly formatted works.
%
% The marks for each question are given in the [] brackets.
% e.g. [3] is three marks.
%
% *Total Marks:*

% Convert to our binary class data of "early" vs "advanced" stage of MS.
C = zeros(size(targets,1),1);

% A cut-off of 0.3 is arbitrarily chosen so we have equal number of early
% and advanced patients.

%% Q1. Create two matrices for early and advanced patients [1]
% Create two separate observation matrices where one contains only the
% patients with the "early" (0) class labels, and the other contains
% patients with only the "advanced" (1) class labels.
%
% All the features should be included in the matrix. But the class label
% should NOT be included.
%
% Note that you need to order your features properly to pass the test

%% Q2. Explore separating the data based on 1 feature (1D) [0.5]
% Let's use the last feature, which should correspond to the "volume"
% features. This is the volume of the patients' spinal cord.
%
% On a single figure, plot the "volume" feature from the "early"
% observation matrix in blue, and the "volume" feature from the "advanced"
% matrix in red.
%
% Note how much the two classes overlap and we cannot distinguish "early" from
% "advanced" from a single feature alone.
%
% Also, show how much the two histograms overlap
